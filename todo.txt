== ML Course Project ==

Hypothesis for Project Proposal and more informations at [https://github.com/mmaker/braindecoding]
Section Dataset
* may be in the near future we provide an encoding where frequency are computed on subintervals of the whole trial duration, i.e. 't' will be a multiple of 6

Section Problem
* define for each classifier the format of the data in input and the data in output

New Section
* you should introduce a new Section after Section 3 devoted to describe the process of evaluation of the stacked classifiers.
* the new section should sketch the procedure to train and test the proposed stacked architecture
* this part is the most tricky one of the project; do not underestimate its complexity
* the first part of the Section should state what kind of evaluation measure you will apply (you may start considering the 'accuracy' as reference evaluation measure)
* the second part should sketch the procedure to estimate without bias the evaluation measure (this is the core of the project)
* we should discuss carefully the design of this procedure once you have a first version

Additional new Section
* here you should illustrate what kind of empirical analysis you plan to perform
* here you will report also the results of your empirical assessment
* do a first hypothesis of what you are planning to test
* we discuss this plan before to implement it

Next steps
* Danilo will give you a copy of data according to the description above
* Contact in advance Danilo to find an agreement on data format
* Next version of the report
* Discussion of the evaluation procedure (see new section)
